# MemeBot

This is a Discord bot that will pull a random top meme from a specific sub reddit. You can change the sub reddit in the function get_random_meme_url()
The Discord bot also gived bitcoin/eth/ltc with the exclamation point command

Examples:

!meme
!btc
!eth
!ltc
!Hey

Another Cool thing about this program is it gives you the top comment of the meme that just showed.

!meme
!topcomment


This is mostly just for my discord server where I try new programs to mess around with :)

To run the program yourself you will need 3 API's Reddit/Discord/X-CMC_PRO The last one for crypto
